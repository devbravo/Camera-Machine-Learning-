# Camera-Machine-Learning-
Building a Ml model that can predict the price of a camera based on certain features

# Problem is a linear regression problem, numerical input, numerical output

1. Understand the data using EDA
2. Clean the data, check for missing values
3. Visualize the data using different plots (check the distribution)
4. Split the data into training and testing
5. Outlier detection done using these algorithsm (LocalOutlierFactor, IsolationForest, OneClassSVM, EllipticEnvelope) Final algorithm used is EllipticEnvelope
